# Five years, building a culture, and handing it off.
August 31st, 2015

Theory 1: Nothing we “know” about software development should be assumed to be true.

Most of our tools, our mental models, and our practices are remnants of an era (possibly fictional) where software was written by solo practitioners, but **modern software is a team sport**.

Theory 3: Software development should be thought of as a cycle of continual learning and improvement rather a progression from start to finish, or a search for correctness.

**If you aren’t shipping, you aren’t learning.** If it slows down shipping, it probably isn’t worth it. Maturity is knowing when to make the trade off and when not to.

Theory 5: If you want to build for the long term, the only guarantee is change.

Invest in your people and your ability to ask questions, not your current answers. Your current answers are wrong, or they will be soon.

Five years ago, **continuous deployment** was still a heretical idea. The idea you could do it with over 250 engineers was, to me at least, literally unimaginable.

Five years ago, it was crazy to discuss that **monitoring, testing, debugging, QA, staged releases, game days, user research, and prototypes** are all tools with the same goal, improving confidence, rather than separate disciplines handled by distinct teams.

Five years ago, focusing on **detection and response vs prevention** in order to achieve better, more reliable, more scalable, and more secure software was unprofessional.

Five years ago, suggesting that better software is written by a **diverse team of kind people who care about each other** was antithetical to our self-image as an industry.

Five years ago, trusting not only our designers and product managers to code and deploy to production, but trusting everyone in the company to deploy to production, **trusting engineers to meet customers**, and trusting teams on the edges to use data to make their own decisions went against everything we’d been taught about how we were supposed run a software development company.

Five years ago, rooms of people **excitedly talking about their own contribution to a serious outage** would have been a prelude to mass firings, rather than a path to profound learning.

And five years ago no one was **experimenting in public about how to do this stuff, sharing their findings, and open sourcing code** to support this way of working.

Five years ago, it would have seemed ludicrous to think a small team supporting a small site selling crafts could aspire to change how software is built and, in the process, cause us to rethink how the economy works.

These last 5 years testing the theories, making discoveries, growing a team who has changed how software is built, supporting the flowering of a tech scene here in New York — I’m incredibly proud and grateful to have been a part of it. And I’m proud to have been part of growing Etsy from a tiny, not-always-online website to a billion dollar public company that challenges conventional notions of whether you can be led by values, other than selfishness, and be a successful business at the same time.
