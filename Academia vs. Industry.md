# Academia vs. Industry

As a former academic, Iâ€™m often asked about the difference between academia and industry. 
There are many answers to this, including the fact that **in industry you need to solve the entire problem** rather than cherry pick the nugget you wish to solve elegantly. 

The main difference, however, which can be very subtle and perhaps only obvious in hindsight is the following. [...] In academia, as you pursue your passion for science and technology, the evaluation of faculty creates pressure to further your career **as an individual**, whether it is through publications, graduating and promoting your students or being an excellent educator. You are by necessity the champion of your own ideas, which I think is ultimately a critical ingredient to scientific progress. 

In contrast, to be successful in industry, whether in engineering or in research, you often need to **put your individual goals and ideas aside.** You need to find the most effective way to get to a great product or service (or part thereof) even if it means finding the right mix of ideas. 

You will be rewarded for contributing key ideas to a product, but you will be **rewarded even more for getting the job done**, collaborating effectively across teams, and pleasing customers. This advice may be even more useful for academics founding startups. Once you founded your company based on the great research you conducted at the university, the company takes a life of its own and the most important goal is to create a product that users want.
