# Academia vs. Industry

As a former academic, Iâ€™m often asked about the difference between academia and industry. 

There are many answers to this, including the fact that **in industry you need to solve the entire problem** rather than cherry pick the nugget you wish to solve elegantly. 

[...]

In contrast, to be successful in industry, whether in engineering or in research, you often need to put your individual goals and ideas aside .You need to **find the most effective way to get to a great product** or service (or part thereof) even if it means **finding the right mix of ideas**. 

You will be rewarded for contributing key ideas to a product, but you will be **rewarded even more for getting the job done**, collaborating effectively across teams, and pleasing customers.
